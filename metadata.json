    "description": "Manage multiple PCBs from a single schematic. Create sub-boards that share one root schematic, with automatic component synchronization, ownership tracking, and inter-board port definitions.",
    "description_full": "Multi-Board PCB Manager enables hierarchical PCB workflows where one root schematic drives multiple independent PCB layouts.\n\nKey Features:\n• Single source of truth: All boards share one schematic via hardlinks/symlinks\n• Ownership rule: Components belong to the first board they're placed on\n• Update command: Sync new components from schematic to any board\n• Inter-board ports: Define electrical connection points between boards\n• Health reports: Monitor board status and detect issues\n• DRC integration: Run connectivity checks across all boards\n• Open board detection: Prevents dangerous operations on boards open in KiCad\n\nPerfect for:\n• Modular systems with shared circuitry\n• Products with regional variants\n• Designs requiring different form factors\n• Test boards and production boards from same schematic",
